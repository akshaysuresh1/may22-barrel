## Project Goal <a name="project"></a>

Home to over 1.38 billion people, India is tackling a severe hunger crisis. Rice is the staple food crop for over 50% of India's
population. Though the country has achieved grain self-sufficiency in production, nearly 14% of its population is still undernourished. India's agricultural landscape is primarily rural, where widespread poverty, low literacy rates, and poor infrastructure lead to questions over its sustainability. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers has led to significant vagaries in crop production despite consistent agricultural subsidies. <br>

With the current global shortage of fertilizers, precision farming is vital to eliminate redundant costs and streamline resources to ensure equitable food access for all communities. Here, we assist agriculture policy-makers in their decisions by predicting the expected fertilizer consumption
(NPK: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash) to obtain a specific rice yield.  <br>

## Methodology <a name="methods"></a>
Rice is a hardy crop capable of thriving in a variety of soils, including loams, silts, and gravel. Collating up to 26 years of district-level rice cultivation (cropped area, yield, irrigated area) and environment data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, evapotranspiration), our data processing strategy can be described in two steps. <br>

1. Firstly, we strived to group districts with similar ecological parameters into "clusters." To do so, we tested out two unsupervised learning approaches, i.e., K-means and hierarchical clustering. <br>

2. We regressed the historical NPK consumption data from each cluster against their respective rice yields. Our set of experimented models includes simple linear regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression. <br>

## Clustering <a name="clustering"></a>

Based on environmental features, both K-means and hierarchical clustering show remarkable visual agreement in the segmentation of India into 6 distinct rice-growing clusters. Here is a map of India showing the spatial grouping of districts generated by our hierarchical clustering algorithm. <br>


We note that the above map bears close resemble to the Koppen climate classification map of India. However, we caution readers that differences are expected as our algorithms additionally incorporate soil-dependent parameters such as surface runoff and evapotranspiration. <br>
## Modeling <a name="models"></a>

## Future Work <a name="future"></a>
Future extensions to our model will incorporate soil nutrient data and knowledge of off-season farming practices (e.g., crop rotation) to improve the accuracy of our estimated fertilizer inputs. <br>

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
Please submit an issue to voice any problems or requests. Suggestions that will help improve our data analyses are always welcome.
