## Project Goal <a name="project"></a>

Home to over 1.38 billion people, India is tackling a severe hunger crisis. Rice is the staple food crop for over 50% of India's
population. Though the country has achieved grain self-sufficiency in production, nearly 14% of its population is still undernourished. India's agricultural landscape is primarily rural, where widespread poverty, low literacy rates, and poor infrastructure lead to questions over its sustainability. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers has led to significant vagaries in crop production despite consistent agricultural subsidies. <br>

With the current global shortage of fertilizers, precision farming is vital to eliminate redundant costs and streamline resources to ensure equitable food access for all communities. Here, we assist agriculture policy-makers in their decisions by predicting the expected fertilizer consumption
(nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash) to obtain a specific rice yield.  <br>

## Modeling <a name="models"></a>

## Future Work <a name="future"></a>
Future extensions to our model will incorporate soil nutrient data and knowledge of off-season farming practices (e.g., crop rotation) to improve the accuracy of our estimated fertilizer inputs. <br>

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
Please submit an issue to voice any problems or requests. Suggestions that will help improve our data analyses are always welcome.
