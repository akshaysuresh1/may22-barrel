### Files: <br>
1. `ICRISAT_evapotranspiration_actual.csv`: Monthly evapotranspiration data (1958 &ndash; 2015) <br>
Actual amount of water lost to evapotranspiration from the soilâ€“ plant continuum by an actively growing plant or crop. Water loss through evapotranspiration depends upon plant and soil characteristics, and upon the amount of available water in the soil. <br> 

2. `ICRISAT_hyv_rice.csv`: Yield, production, and harvested area of High Yielding Varieties (HYVs/hybrids) of rice (1990 &ndash; 2011) <br>
The data on HYVs has a number of gaps in recent years implying that the area is completely under HYVs and hence, no longer reported / some states do not publish these data. <br>
 
3. `ICRISAT_max_temp.csv`: Monthly maximum temperature (1958 &ndash; 2015) <br>

4. `ICRISAT_min_temp.csv`: Monthly minimum temperature (1958 &ndash; 2015) <br>

5. `ICRISAT_npk.csv`: NPK fertilizer use data (1990 &ndash; 2017) <br>
Kilogram of fertilizer used per hectare of cropped area. Crop-wise data are not available. <br>

6. `ICRISAT_prec.csv`: Monthly precipitation data (1958 &ndash; 2015) <br>
Precipitation includes all forms of atmospheric water vapor that condense and fall under gravity. E.g., rain, snow, and hail. <br>

7. `ICRISAT_rice.csv`: Yield, production, and harvested area of rice (1990 &ndash; 2017) <br>

8. `ICRISAT_rice_irrigation.csv`: Rice-irrigated area (1990 &ndash; 2017) <br>

9. `ICRISAT_runoff.csv`: Monthly surface runoff data (1958 &ndash; 2015) <br>
When rain or snow falls onto the earth, it starts moving along the slopes. A portion of it seeps into the soil and to replenish Earth's groundwater. Most of it flows downhill as runoff when rainfall intensity is more than the seepage or infiltration. <br>

10. `ICRISAT_windspeed.csv`: Monthly wind speed (1958 &ndash; 2015) <br> 
Wind speeds are measured in units of m/s. <br>

11. `KAGGLE_[CityName].csv`: Hourly data on multiple parameters including precipitation, cloud cover and temperature in major cities (2009 &ndash; 2019) <br>
